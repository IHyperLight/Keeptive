# Keeptive - Automated Window Interaction Tool

Keeptive is a Python-based Windows automation tool designed to interact with the windows on your system by simulating user actions such as clicks and mouse movements to keep them active. The script can handle one or multiple windows simultaneously, manage their states (minimized or restored) to ensure they receive the interaction, and even keep your PC awake for as long as you choose. It also offers options to pause based on window focus, define the interval between interactions, and run for a set duration or indefinitely.

## Features

- **Four Automated Activation Modes for Different Situations: Clicking, Movement, Passive, and Key**: Simulates four types of interaction with target windows or the entire system, as appropriate.

- **Window State Management**: Handles minimized windows, restores them for interaction, and then re-minimizes them without disrupting the user experience.

- **Customizable Timed Execution**: Run tasks for a specified duration or continuously until manually stopped.

- **Focus-Aware Clicking**: Optional pause functionality to avoid interaction when the target window is already in the foreground.
